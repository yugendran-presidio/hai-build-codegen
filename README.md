## ✨ Features

### 📝 HAI Tasks
Harness the power of AI for seamless task management and user-story execution, HAI Code Generator integrates tasks generated by [Specif AI](https://github.com/presidio-oss/specif-ai), allowing them to be loaded directly into the HAI Tasks page. This streamlined process enables you to:

- **Review** AI-generated tasks within a dedicated interface.  
- **Execute** them instantly with a single click.  
- **Manage** all tasks in one place for improved clarity and productivity.  

By centralizing AI-driven tasks in HAI Code Generator, you can maintain an efficient workflow from ideation to execution.

- **In-Depth Story Review**  
  - View a story in detail by clicking the Eye icon, along with the corresponding list of tasks, providing comprehensive insights into objectives, prerequisites, and outcomes. 
  
- **In-Depth Task Review**  
  - Similar to user stories, tasks can be viewed in detail and executed directly from the same interface.

### 📊 Telemetry
Configure external telemetry settings to monitor and analyze your AI-powered development workflows with environment-specific customization capabilities.

- **External Configuration Override**  
  - Support for telemetry configuration overrides via a `.hai.config` file placed at the root of your workspace.
  - Enables environment-specific customization that can be dynamically injected through CI/CD pipelines.

- **Supported Override Parameters**  
  ```
  # Langfuse Configuration
  langfuse.apiUrl=
  langfuse.apiKey=
  langfuse.publicKey=
  
  # PostHog Configuration
  posthog.url=
  posthog.apiKey=
  ```

**Important Notes:**  
- The `.hai.config` file is not git-excluded by default. Ensure sensitive keys are not committed unintentionally to your repository.

## ✨ Upcoming Features

### 🧑‍💻 Experts

The **Experts** feature enables HAI Code Generator to deliver context-aware code generation tailored to specific technologies or domains.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/gifs/experts.gif" alt="Experts Feature Demo" />
  <p><i>Experts</i></p>
</div>

#### Built-in Experts

- Four built-in experts are available: **.NET, Terraform, Node.js, and Go**.
- Each provides predefined guidelines and best practices in read-only mode for quick reference.

#### Custom Experts

- Users can create custom experts to define their own guidelines and (optionally) attach up to three reference document links.
- Custom experts are stored in the `.hai-experts` folder under a subfolder named after the expert.
- Each expert folder contains:
  - `metadata.json`: Stores expert name, creation date, and any document links.
  - `prompt.md`: Contains the expert’s guidelines (required).
- If document links are provided, a `docs` folder is created with:
  - Markdown files for each processed document.
  - `status.json` to track processing status.

**Note:**  
- Expert name and guidelines are mandatory when creating a custom expert.  
- Document links are optional and can be added for richer context.

This feature allows you to extend HAI Code Generator’s knowledge with your own standards, best practices, and documentation—ensuring more accurate and relevant code generation for your unique stack.
